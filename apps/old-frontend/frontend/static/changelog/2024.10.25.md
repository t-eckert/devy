## Mark & Spark

Mark, book- and -down. I added bookmarking which will let you save posts for later.
I also rewrote the entire markdown renderer (adding syntax highlighting and code
copying along the way).

The spark is your brand new profile page! I think it's pretty. I can't decide if I like
the serif font for the header. Let me know.

There is now a feedback link on the homepage. There's an open graph image for the whole site.
Every blog post also has appropriate open graph titles and metadata.

The site updates your profile information from GitHub on every login. You can delete your
own blog now. A handful of UI bugs were squished on mobile.
