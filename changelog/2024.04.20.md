# `v2024.04.20` Minimum Viable Devy

## Release Notes

This is a milestone where I feel Devy is good enough to start opening up to some early users.

In this version, the profile display is a lot nicer, with a cool "Calling Card" showing details about a profile. The entry previews are more modular so they don't show duplicate information (like the author when you are on a page of posts only by the author). The time since a post was created is now corrected for timezone. The auth login won't error in Chrome. There's a new documentation page. The mobile view is also a lot nicer!

Finally, I came up with a logo/wordmark that I'm trialing.
