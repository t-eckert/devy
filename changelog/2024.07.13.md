# Don't Call it a Rewrite `v2024.07.13`

It's kind of a rewrite. This release brings substantial updates and improvements across multiple components, with a strong focus on enhancing the frontend, improving the backend, and upgrading key dependencies.

The frontend has undergone a significant overhaul with the upgrade to Svelte 5. This includes updating all relevant packages, components, and configurations. Several legacy components and hooks have been removed to streamline the codebase. The UI has been refined, with changes like removing the vertical margin from the `Main` component, updating the feed component, and implementing dark mode for some elements. The onboarding process has been improved, and a new onboarding page has been added to guide new users. Additionally, the navigation in feeds has been restyled, and the new feed component is now in use.

The authentication system has been improved with the addition of email validation, JWT encoding and decoding using a fixed key, and extending the token lifetime. Routes are now protected with auth middleware, enhancing the overall security. The API has been reconfigured to separate out configuration details, and a new route for getting the public key has been added.

A new `GitHubClient` has been introduced to streamline interactions with GitHub. User GitHub endpoints have been added, and the GitHub-related routes are now better protected. The integration test framework has been completely reworked to ensure robustness and reliability.

The system now logs diffing operations in the uploader, which also received various fixes and improvements for handling webhooks and syncing posts. The session handling has been updated to use a new configuration, and several old crates have been removed to clean up the codebase. The site now features a consistent button design, a new error page style, and improved legibility of menu items.
