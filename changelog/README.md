# Changelog

This changelog catalogs the development of the entire Devy project. I decided not to use Semantic Versioning because I do not form an API
contract with an external party. However, I did choose the `x.x.x` numbering format because it communicates a similar degree of platform
change.

- Each major version is an establishing point where the project has reached maturity.
- Each minor version represents a single cycle of work with an overall theme.
- Each patch is another release of the site working towards that goal.

The versions correspond to Git tags in the repository.
