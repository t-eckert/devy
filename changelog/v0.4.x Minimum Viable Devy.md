# `v0.4.x` Minimum Viable Devy

`1 December 2023` - `Ongoing`

## `v0.4.0` Frontend Reset

This is a return to simplicity for the frontend. I restarted the application UI in Svelte. I've cut back some features that I will bring back in the future. I've found myself getting caught up in implementation details, the goal with this version is to get back to the basics and build up from there. My focus is shipping a minimum viable product.
