CSS weaves a spell of colors, fonts, and layouts, making web pages look captivating and delightful. By modifying the appearance and positioning of HTML elements, developers create beautiful experiences for users.

```css
body {
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
    font-family: "Verdana", sans-serif;
}

h1 {
    color: #333333;
    font-size: 36px;
    text-align: center;
}

p {
    color: #666666;
    font-size: 18px;
    text-align: justify;
}

img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
