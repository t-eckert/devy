    markdown: `# They Didn't Tell Me I Had to Eat the Two Pizzas: Stories of an IC Turned Manager

It was my first week as a manager and I was feeling overwhelmed. Not only was I
responsible for my own work, but I now had a team of engineers to manage as well.

One day, I received an email from my boss asking me to order lunch for a team 
meeting. No problem, I thought. I'll just order a few pizzas and everyone will be happy.

But when the pizzas arrived, I was in for a surprise. My boss had ordered two 
extra-large pizzas and told me to make sure everyone ate at least one slice. I couldn't believe it. They didn't tell me I had to eat the two pizzas!

I quickly realized that being a manager wasn't just about delegating tasks and 
managing schedules. It also meant taking on additional responsibilities and tasks that no one else wanted to do.

But as I continued in my role as a manager, I learned to embrace these unexpected
challenges and use them as opportunities to grow and learn. And while I may never
enjoy eating two extra-large pizzas in one sitting, I know that being a manager
means being ready for anything.`,
