> git push blog

Devy is a platform for developers to share their knowledge and ideas.
It enables anyone with a GitHub account and repository to publish a blog
by just pushing markdown files with Git.

> NOTE:
> All Dockerfile contexts and Fly deployment configurations assume the root
> of the repo is the context. For best results, use the Makefile!
