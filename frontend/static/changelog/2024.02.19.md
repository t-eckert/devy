# `v2024.02.19` Initialization

## Release Notes

This is a new start for the project. I decided to restructure the backend using some of the learnings from the initial development.

I also decided to version the packages with an overall date-based version scheme.

Lastly, the frontend is a rewrite from scratch using SvelteKit.
