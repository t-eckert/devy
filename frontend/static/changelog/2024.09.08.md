# Intercontinental Supernovae Warfare

Chappel Roan versus Oasis; red wine versus champagne; obviously.

In the same way, frontend versus backend development pull me in different directions.
For this release much of the work has been in the backend, cleaning up patterns I've
notice develop and setting up the backend for future roadmap features!

## Features

### Drafts

You can write posts using drafts! Just use the `is_draft: true` frontmatter in your markdown.

For example,

```markdown
---
is_draft: true
---

# Secret Revelations

I'm not ready to share this with everyone yet.

```

Draft posts are still public and can be found at their URL, but they won't show up
in feed or on your profile and blog pages.

## Improvements

- Brand new navigation menu that is much more accessible and can close on outside clicks.
- If you define `title` in your frontmatter, the uploader will pick that up and use it as the title for the post.
- You can now have "bookmarked" and "liked" collections. They are not completely wired up in the frontend yet.
- Performance improvements with better calculation of like counts. I wrote about this [on my Devy blog](https://devy.page/field-theories/fixing-likes-on-devy)!
- Performance improvements from indexing `blog_slug`.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed bug on Firefox where `Set.difference()` was not supported. Thanks [Lars Ellingsen]() for finding this!
