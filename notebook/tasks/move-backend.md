# Move Backend

Fl0 is shutting down. I'll need to run the backend somewhere else.

## Railway

Postgres on Railway: https://docs.railway.app/guides/postgresql

## Fly

I worked with this before. I had some frustrations, but it's cheap and uses 
containerization as a first-class offering. They don't have managed Postgres.
They do have Postgres as an offering. It's "managed" enough for me.
They do have Sentry built-in.

I'll go with Fly.
