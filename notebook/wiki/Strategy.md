# Devy Strategy

The project is still very early stage. It doesn't have any real users yet.

## Rules

No technology changes. I feel this FOMO looking at tools like Astro and Remix while working with Next. It feels like this is this big push in the web dev community away from Next. Just keep using Next. It's great! It can do all of the things you need it to do and the problems that are causing people to move away from it are problems you don't have!

Solve the current problem in the most efficient way.


Kevin Ball from Changelog uses Substack. He is a developer working to build his brand. He is a perfect candidate for the project.

Notes from KBall:

> There’s a couple of things for me when it comes to a publishing platform…First, I tend to think of content in a “hub and spokes” manner… there’s one place content lives, and then I “push it out” via email, sometimes republishing on places like medium, etc. Substack is nice because it lets me do both in one go, publish to the web, and push out via email.Next, as my “hub”, I’m looking for a way to “own” my contacts. Email is the canonical way to do this -> If someone subscribes via email, I can take that subscription with me to a new platform if I need to (assuming the platform allows me to export emails on my list, which is a must have for me). Platform-level follows (e.g. how it works on medium, [dev.to](http://dev.to/), youtube, and essentially any social media site) are nice but subject to the whimsy of the changes of the platform, whereas I know I’ll always be able to email.Last thing that comes to mind is I love if the platform is thinking about/solving for distribution, not just publishing. Some of this is having “naturally good” SEO characteristics. Some might be having a social layer (Substack is the first I’ve seen trying to do this for newsletters). This is what got me onto substack rather than just publishing on my own site + using an email provider like mailchimp (which is what I’ve done in the past).
