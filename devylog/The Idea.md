# The Idea

My goal with Devy is to provide a platform where anyone who can push Markdown to a GitHub repository
can have a way to easily share their ideas with the world while maintaining ownership of their writings.
The idea for Devy was formed around the issues with Twitter and Reddit that I felt were leading the 
Internet as a whole into a new era of content sharing.
